				 * Aggregate induction motor load. This model  is used to represent a fraction of
				 * an ordinary load as "induction motor load".  It allows load that is treated as
				 * ordinary constant power in power flow analysis to be represented by an
				 * induction motor in dynamic simulation.  If <b>Lpp</b> = 0. or <b>Lpp</b> =
				 * <b>Lp</b>, or <b>Tppo</b> = 0.,  only one cage is represented. Magnetic
				 * saturation is not modelled. Either a "one-cage" or "two-cage" model of the
				 * induction machine can be modelled. Magnetic saturation is not modelled.
				 * 
				 * This model is intended for representation of aggregations of many motors
				 * dispersed through a load represented at a high voltage bus but where there is
				 * no information on the characteristics of individual motors.
				 * 
				 * This model treats a fraction of the constant power part of a load as a motor.
				 * During initialisation, the initial power drawn by the motor is set equal to
				 * <b>Pfrac</b> times the constant <b>P</b> part of the static load.  The
				 * remainder of the load is left as static load.
				 * 
				 * The reactive power demand of the motor is calculated during initialisation as a
				 * function of voltage at the load bus. This reactive power demand may be less
				 * than or greater than the constant <b>Q</b> component of the load.  If the
				 * motor's reactive demand is greater than the constant <b>Q</b> component of the
				 * load, the model inserts a shunt capacitor at the terminal of the motor to bring
				 * its reactive demand down to equal the constant <b>Q</b> reactive load.
				 * If a motor model and a static load model are both present for a load, the motor
				 * <b>Pfrac</b> is assumed to be subtracted from the power flow constant <b>P</b>
				 * load before the static load model is applied.  The remainder of the load, if
				 * any, is then represented by the static load model.
