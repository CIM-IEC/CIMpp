			 * A Measurement represents any measured, calculated or non-measured non-
			 * calculated quantity. Any piece of equipment may contain Measurements, e.g. a
			 * substation may have temperature measurements and door open indications, a
			 * transformer may have oil temperature and tank pressure measurements, a bay may
			 * contain a number of power flow measurements and a Breaker may contain a switch
			 * status measurement.
			 * The PSR - Measurement association is intended to capture this use of
			 * Measurement and is included in the naming hierarchy based on EquipmentContainer.
			 * The naming hierarchy typically has Measurements as leafs, e.g. Substation-
			 * VoltageLevel-Bay-Switch-Measurement.
			 * Some Measurements represent quantities related to a particular sensor location
			 * in the network, e.g. a voltage transformer (PT) at a busbar or a current
			 * transformer (CT) at the bar between a breaker and an isolator. The sensing
			 * position is not captured in the PSR - Measurement association. Instead it is
			 * captured by the Measurement - Terminal association that is used to define the
			 * sensing location in the network topology. The location is defined by the
			 * connection of the Terminal to ConductingEquipment.
			 * If both a Terminal and PSR are associated, and the PSR is of type
			 * ConductingEquipment, the associated Terminal should belong to that
			 * ConductingEquipment instance.
			 * When the sensor location is needed both Measurement-PSR and Measurement-
			 * Terminal are used. The Measurement-Terminal association is never used alone.
